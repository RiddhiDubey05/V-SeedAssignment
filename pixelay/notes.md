# Pixelay Verification Notes

## Visible Differences & Observations
   Typography: Used Google Font "Inter" as a modern sans-serif fallback since the original font family was not specified in the text dump. The weight and spacing might differ slightly from the Figma outline.
   Spacing: Vertical spacing and gaps were implemented according to the provided CSS snippets (e.g., 200px gaps in footer), which might appear large on standard screens but are faithful to the raw specs.
   Assets: Placeholder rectangles and gradients were used for "Frames" where no image assets were provided.

## Interaction
   Mobile Menu: Implemented a fully functional hamburger menu for mobile devices (< 768px). The menu toggles a dropdown with smooth transition.
